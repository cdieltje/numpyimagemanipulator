Image manipulator

With this project you can perform different image manipulations.
The project is divide into two notebooks:
- image_manipulations.ipynb: manipulations of image: multiplying, flipping and colouring images. These are one-offs, without generalisation functions. 
- image_manipulation_functions.ipynb: Generalisation functionsof image manipulations: image multiplication, grid with flips, colourful grid, grid with degrading colours, blurrer

Each notebook starts with the loading of an image.
Each function can be applied to different images, and with different counts of rows and columns. 

Necessary data:
- an image is needed in order to run the Jupyter Notebooks, an example is available: /data/input/image_raw.png
- other images could be used if named as 'image_raw.png' or if naming will be changed in code 
- no other data than an image is needed
- for some functionalities user input will be asked

Necessary packages:
See image_manipulator.yml for a full list of environment, amongst others:
- numpy Version 1.26.3
- numpy-base Version 1.26.3
- notebook (Jupyter Notebook) Version 6.5.4
