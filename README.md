# numpyimagemanipulator
Assignment: Setting Up Project and Developing a Production Simulation Program

With this project you can perform the following tasks concerning an image:
- Jupyter Notebook with manipulation of image: multiplying, flipping and colouring images 
- Jupyter Notebook with Generalisation function of image manipulations
Each block contains all functions for every of the three manipulations.
Each block can run separate from the other blocks, apart from the first block where the image is loaded.


Necessary data:
- an image is needed in order to run the Jupyter Notebooks, an example is available: /data/input/image_raw.png
- other images could be used if named as 'image_raw.png' or if naming will be changed in code 
- no other data than an image is needed
- for some functionalities user input will be asked

Necessary packages:
See image_manipulator.yml for a full list of environment, amongst others:
- numpy Version 1.26.3
- numpy-base Version 1.26.3
- notebook (Jupyter Notebook) Version 6.5.4
- matplotlib Version 3.8.0
- os Version
- PIL
