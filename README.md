# numpyimagemanipulator
Assignment: Setting Up Project and Developing a Production Simulation Program

With this project you can perform the following tasks concerning an image:
- Jupyter Notebook with manipulations of image: multiplying, flipping and colouring images. These are one-offs, without generalisation functions. 
- Jupyter Notebook with Generalisation function of image manipulations
Each function can be applied to different images, and with different counts of rows and columns. 

Necessary data:
- an image is needed in order to run the Jupyter Notebooks, an example is available: /data/input/image_raw.png
- other images could be used if named as 'image_raw.png' or if naming will be changed in code 
- no other data than an image is needed
- for some functionalities user input will be asked

Necessary packages:
See image_manipulator.yml for a full list of environment, amongst others:
- numpy Version 1.26.3
- numpy-base Version 1.26.3
- notebook (Jupyter Notebook) Version 6.5.4
- matplotlib Version 3.8.0
- os Version
- PIL
