Necessary data:
- an image is needed in order to run the Jupyter Notebooks
- an example image in .png format is available /data/input/image_raw.png
- other images could be used if named as 'image_raw.png' or if naming will be changed in code 
- no other data than the image is needed to run Jupyter Notebooks
- for some functionalities user input will be asked

Necessary packages for the program numpy_image_manipulator:
- numpy Version 1.26.3
- numpy-base Version 1.26.3
- notebook (Jupyter Notebook) Version 6.5.4
- matplotlib Version 3.8.0
- os Version
- PIl Version
